# OLA-Ride-Booking-Analytics-Dashboard-using-SQL-Power-BI

## Project Objective
Developed an interactive OLA ride analytics dashboard using SQL and Power BI to analyze bookings, revenue, cancellations, vehicle performance, and ratings. Created SQL views for data aggregation and visualized KPIs, trends, and customer insights to support data-driven decision making.

## SQL Questions:
1. Retrieve all successful bookings:
2. Find the average ride distance for each vehicle type:
3. Get the total number of cancelled rides by customers:
4. List the top 5 customers who booked the highest number of rides:
5. Get the number of rides cancelled by drivers due to personal and car-related issues:
6. Find the maximum and minimum driver ratings for Prime Sedan bookings:
7. Retrieve all rides where payment was made using UPI:
8. Find the average customer rating per vehicle type:
9. Calculate the total booking value of rides completed successfully:
10. List all incomplete rides along with the reason:

## Power BI Questions:
1. Ride Volume Over Time
2. Booking Status Breakdown
3. Top 5 Vehicle Types by Ride Distance
4. Average Customer Ratings by Vehicle Type
5. cancelled Rides Reasons
6. Revenue by Payment Method
7. Top 5 Customers by Total Booking Value
8. Ride Distance Distribution Per Day
9. Driver Ratings Distribution
10. Customer vs. Driver Ratings

## Project Insights
-The analysis shows a strong overall booking performance, with more than half of the total bookings successfully completed during the selected time period.
-Prime Sedan, Prime SUV, Prime Plus, Mini, and Bike categories contribute almost equally to total booking value, indicating balanced demand across vehicle types.
-Auto rides have a significantly lower average ride distance, highlighting their suitability for short-distance urban travel.
-Cash and UPI dominate as the preferred payment methods, together contributing the majority of total revenue, while card-based payments show lower usage.
-The cancellation rate remains relatively high, with both customer-side and driver-side factors contributing notably to incomplete rides.
-The most common customer cancellation reasons include drivers not moving toward pickup and changes in travel plans.
-Driver cancellations are largely due to personal or vehicle-related issues and customer-related concerns.
-Driver and customer ratings remain stable around 4.0 across all vehicle types, indicating consistent service quality.
-Ride volume shows daily fluctuations, suggesting demand varies based on time and operational conditions rather than steady growth.

## Final Conclusion
The project proves how data analytics can identify operational strengths, customer behavior patterns, and improvement opportunities in ride-hailing services using SQL and Power BI.
